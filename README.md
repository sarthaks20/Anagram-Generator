# Anagram Generator

• Implemented an efficient algorithm that produced all valid anagrams of an input string using polynomial rolling hash function; generated anagrams were made up of words from a given vocabulary and could contain up to two spaces

• Double hashing was used to resolve collisions; devised an optimized approach to search through anagrams’ space
